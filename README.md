Browser based card deck for stack card games for when someone forgets their deck and wants to play :P

At the moment deck refreshes when the page is loaded.
NOTE! This means that if another client opens this page the first client has their deck resuffled.
This is because the deck lives in the API and all clients use the same deck.
Not a problem as long as this page is only used by the author but later some client based deck should be implemented.
